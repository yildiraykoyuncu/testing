#### `favorite-words`

> [Starter Code](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/weekly-assignments#projects)

Collaboration!  This project should be completed in groups.  Generate a new repo for your team using [favorite-words](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/favorite-words) and have at it.  There are is no right or wrong development strategy, and there is no right or wrong user interface!  What matters is that you agree as a team, and that your plan is clearly communicated in your repository.

_**Reverse Engineering**_

This week's project does not have any tests, instead the objective is to practice _reverse engineering_.  There is a fully-working version of the project in `/demo` with  [obfuscated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)) source code.  You can interact with the demo to understand how your scripts should behave, but will not be able to read the source code.

You'll know the project is complete when it's impossible to tell if you're interacting with the demo or the code your team wrote.  Pay attention to details!
