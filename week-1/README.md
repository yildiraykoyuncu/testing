## Lesson Plan

> during Sunday class
> - [Lesson Plan Slides](./index.html)

Learn some ways to use arrays:

- `for ... of` loops
- _mapping_: transform each entry in an array
- _filtering_: remove certain entries from an array
- _reducing_: combine all entries in an array
- _everying_: does each entry meet a certain criteria?

### Isolate

- `for ... of`: [examples](../isolate/for-of/examples), [exercises](../isolate/for-of/exercises)

### Integrate

Build a simple website that stores user input in an array.

The project this week is not collaborative.  You work together in your small groups, but should not be working on the same repository.

- [Week 1 in-class project](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/testing-integrate-week-1) (starter repo)

Helpful code to study:

- [User input in an array](../integrate/user-input-in-an-array.html)
- The `/example` directory in the project repo

#### `array-of-numbers`

> [Starter Code](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/weekly-assignments#projects)

Collaboration!  This project should be completed in groups.  Generate a new repo for your team using [array-of-numbers](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/array-of-numbers) and have at it.  There are is no right or wrong development strategy, and there is no right or wrong user interface!  What matters is that you agree as a team, and that your plan is clearly communicated in your repository.

This project contains a fully-working version of the project you are supposed to build in the folder called `/demo`.  You can interact with the demo and read the console output to help reverse-engineer the functionality, but the source code is unreadable.  It has been [obfuscated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)) using [obfuscator.io](https://www.obfuscator.io/).
